    </head>
    <body>
        My name is Catherine Li and I am majoring in architecture and minoring in information management and technology. I am interested in low-carbon footprint processes and building materials and graphic design.
I am proficient in Adobe software (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom) and 3D modeling software such as Rhino. Furthermore, in 2023 I was a part of SU and ESF’s Solar Decathlon, a project hosted by the US Energy Department, and won a finalist title in the mixed housing department. I have also done three architecture design internships in the past summers.
I like to read and cook, especially for friends and family. I also enjoy spending time with my dog Pepper, who just so happens to be on campus with me this semester. Additionally, in 2024, I was able to travel abroad for two semesters, Seoul and Florence, in which I had many rich experiences and opportunities to meet people from around the world!
