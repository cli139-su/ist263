        <h1>Catherine Li's Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p> My name is Catherine Li and I am majoring in <strong>architecture</strong> and minoring in <strong>information management and technology</strong>. I am interested in low-carbon footprint processes and building materials and graphic design. Furthermore, in 2023 I was a part of SU and ESF’s Solar Decathlon, a project hosted by the US Energy Department, and won a finalist title in the mixed housing department. I have also done three architecture design internships in the past summers.</p>

<p>I am proficient in: 
    <ul>
        <li>Photoshop</li>
        <li>Illustrator</li>
        <li>InDesign</li>
        <li>Lightroom</li>
        <li>Rhino3D</li>
    </ul>

<p>
I like to read and cook, especially for friends and family. I also enjoy spending time with my dog Pepper, who just so happens to be on campus with me this semester. Additionally, in 2024, I was able to travel abroad for two semesters, Seoul and Florence, in which I had many rich experiences and opportunities to meet people from around the world!
