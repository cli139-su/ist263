    Hi there, I’m Catherine Li!
    <br><br>
    Welcome to my site about recipes that I’ve made in college, designed to help you get through your education away from home with a happy stomach and wallet. As a fellow college student myself, I try to keep a budget for my meals, which can include meal preparation and bulk shopping. I am also studying architecture, so with my rigorous schedule, I understand your grievances about saving time!
    <br><br>
    My family originated from northern China, so some of my dishes take inspiration from there. However, I have also included different recipes depending on what I was feeling at that time on my website. Don’t you also love a good variety?
