          Growing up, I’ve only had this dish a couple of times. However, recently, I was craving it while it was snowing so I made it. Originally, this dish is supposed to be in meatball form and deep fried. However, I took on a time and health approach, so I made the meatballs into patties and pan-fried them instead in their own juices. I also skipped a lot of steps to make this faster. OMG they were so good! I froze the leftovers in Ziploc bags and they reheated great in the microwave—perfect for weekday meal prep!
