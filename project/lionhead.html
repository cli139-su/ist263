    <p>
        Growing up, I’ve only had this dish a couple of times. However, recently, I was craving it while it was snowing so I made it. Originally, this dish is supposed to be in meatball form and deep fried. However, I took on a time and health approach, so I made the meatballs into patties and pan fried it instead in its own juices. I also skipped a lot of steps to make this faster. OMG they were so good! I freezed the leftovers in Ziploc bags and they turned out good even when it was reheated in the microwave, so you should definitely meal prep this dish for quick and easy weekday meals!
